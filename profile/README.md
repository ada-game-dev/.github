# Ada Game Development (an organisation)

I've set up this organisation to allow others to more easily work on SDLAda and to organise other game development specific libs for Ada in one place.

Only non-GPL'd projects will be found here (LGPL maybe a possibility), the GPL causes issues in some places where I'd like to see these libraries used, App Stores, and therefore I won't allow them here. This does not mean that some of these libs won't bind to commercial libraries, they will, but these libraries will be useable on platforms with their commercial licences.

Note: Still working this stuff out.

## The Plan
