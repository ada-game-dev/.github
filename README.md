# Ada Game Development (an organisation)

I've set this organisation up to allow others to more easily work on SDLAda and to organise other game development specific libs for Ada one place.

Only non-GPL'd projects will be found here, the GPL causes issues in some places where I'd like to see these libraries used, App Stores, and therefore I won't allow them here.

Note: Still working this stuff out.
